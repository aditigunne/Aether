# Aether
Aether : hybrid car. Aether is my hybrid car concept designed to explore innovative ways of combining quantum sensors and nano sensors with modern mechatronics. this repository includes the concept for this project and also the early development idea for my project.  this repository shows my process of building a smarter, more efficient vehicles.
##About this project                                                                                                                                                                            Aether is a project i designed which is focused on designing a hybrid car system with smart features like dual driving modes and advanced sensors. The goal is to improve efficiency, safety, and performance in future vehicles. This project explores how combining different technologies can create a more adaptable and eco friendly driving experience. The reason behind me designing such a project is to bridge the gap between humans and artifial intelligence. The desired balance is aquired by bridging the gap with the cocepts that have been researched previously but have not been frequently used in the automobile industry. The concepts that help us align with the the goal are as follows:-                                                                    1. adaptive control                                                                                                                                                                            2.

## Dual Driving Mode ##                                                                                                                                                                         The dual driving system is provided with two distinct modes, they are:-                                                                                                                        1. Manual driving mode                                                                                                                                                                         2. Automated driving mode                                                                                                                                                                      This key feature replaces the usual mechanical linkages with modern and electronic control. This helps out with most of the issues when it comes to transition of manual mode to automated and vice versa. This key feature allows all the car controls tobe driven in hands of the of the human and also like AI. This key feature help out during ccertein situations where the driver may or may not respond on time. It takes a human about 3 to 7 seconds to assess the situation and then react while the ai system takes control of the situation despite the mode not being set to aautonomous driving mode. This helps immense with the coordination between the humans and artificial intelligence. This happens with the help of the onboard decision making system that responds to human comands and also the can take charge in certain situations. It is going to be cosidered the brain of the car. This operating system is responsible for learning the driving pattern of the driver and hence adjusts itself to the drivering skills of the driver.                                                                   This system is also capable of predicting and avoiding any possible accidents that may occur on the road, it is capable of predetermining the accidents that may occur and is able to avoid it thanks to the operating system being able to make a quick last minute decision. It is also responsible for the overall security of the car.

## Transition Logic Unit                                                                                                                                                                      Responsible for smooth convertion or switch from manual to automation and vice-versa                                                                                                       Takes care of the safety protocols.

## Redundancy Systems                                                                                                                                                                          It is responsible for all the independent steering, working and overall function of the car. It is responsible for all safety measures and protocols taken up by the car's AI system. It launches all the safety measures after the code has been generated by the operating systems. During and emergency situation, the connections are cut off and the circuits are disconnected to decrease the risk. Manages situations involving system failure without complete steering lose. If any system failure occurs, the other sensors output integrate and give a combined output.                                                             
The most important redundancy in aether has to be that the  car uses the 2N back systems. Here N simply represents the unit you wish to duplicate. 
There are 2 types of Data Center redundancy system:- 
1. N + 1
2. 2 N 
Here N+1 indicates an additional component added to support a single failure or required maintenance on a component. Design standards typically call for 1 extra unit for every 4 needed. So if you have, say, 8 UPS units, then you should at least have 10 total UPS units.
While 2N refers to a fully redundant, mirrored system with two independent distribution systems. They are not connected in any way and are not dependent on each other. This means that even if one power source has an interruption or loss of power, the other should still supply power and accommodate full load, thereby eliminating any potential downtime from the loss of one side or leg of the system   
The very difference between N+1 and 2N is that in N+1 only one part in the entire system has a spare part ready. That can prove to be extremely disadvantageous during certain situations where
